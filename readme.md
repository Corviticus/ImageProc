## Overview

An introduction to using OpenCV in Android Studio without having the OpenCV Manager installed.
This allows for lightweight apps that do not require the user to download and install yet another app.

## Motivation

OpenCV is a complete vision library offering tools to perform a variety of useful image processing needs.
This project was created to explore the use of the OpenCV libraries with Android, and specifically how to
use the library in such a manner as to not require the Opencv Manager app.

## Installation

There are numerous examples outlining the usage of OpenCV with Android Studio. I have used the more recent
method of using a CMake file to build the native code. Here are a few samples:
